I'm a third year undergraduate student from [School of EECS](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/) and [James Watt school of Engineering](https://www.gla.ac.uk/), [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/). My research interest includes efficient deep learning, multi-modal models, few-shot learning and graph data mining. My recent research focuses on improving the efficiency of LLM/VLM reasoning.  

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Junming Shao](https://dm.uestc.edu.cn/) of Data Mining Lab from [School of Computer Science](https://www.uestc.edu.cn/), UESTC. At the same time, I am also very fortunate to be advised by [Prof.yang you](https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~youy/), National University of Singapore.
